**[Alpha versions](http://www.wowace.com/addons/grid/files/) r1490 and newer should work on both live realms and Mists of Pandaria beta realms.** Use the "Load out of date addons" checkbox on beta realms; the TOC will *not* be updated until Patch 5.0 goes live.

**What is Grid?**
=================

**Grid is a compact and highly configurable party/raid unit frame addon.**

The compact grid of units lets you select a group member quickly, while keeping a good overview of the whole group. It shows as much information as possible without overloading you. It allows you to customize what information you see, and how you see it.

Grid includes status modules for health, mana, incoming heals, aggro/threat, buffs and debuffs, and range. It supports pets and vehicles. Each unit's frame is a health bar, with additional statuses overlaid on top. Information can be displayed using the center text, the center icon, the frame border, the frame opacity, or the colored square in each of the four corners.

Finally, Grid is written in a modular fashion that makes it easy for developers to add new status modules, new display indicators, or even completely new features. Over 75 [third-party plugins](http://www.wowace.com/addons/grid/pages/list-of-grid-plugins/) are already available!

**How to use Grid**
===================

To open the options window, type `\grid` or right-click the Grid icon on your minimap or DataBroker display.

Due to its flexible design, Grid's options menu can overwhelming at first. We recommend taking a few minutes to look through the menus and check out all the options before asking for help. There is also a small [User's Guide](http://www.wowace.com/projects/grid/pages/users-guide/) that explains some of the core concepts used in Grid, liks *statuses*, *indicators*, and *priorities*. If you have questions or comments, head over to our [WowAce forum thread](http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=18716).


**How to report a bug in Grid**
===============================

Before reporting a bug, please try these quick troubleshooting steps:

1. Double-check that you have the latest stable Release or Beta version of Grid from [Curse.com](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/grid).
2. Disable all other addons, *including* all Grid plugins, and see if the problem still happens.
3. Enable "Display Lua Errors" under Interface Options > Help, or install an error-catching addon like [BugSack](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5995-BugSack.html) to see if there are any Lua error messages.

Then, [submit a bug report](http://www.wowace.com/addons/grid/tickets/?status=+) in the ticket tracker. Check for existing tickets about your bug first, and fill in as much of the requested information in the ticket template as you can. Finally, remember to check back on your ticket in case we need more information from you.

**Please note** that the Grid team cannot provide support for third-party plugins. If you are experiencing problems with a plugin, you will need to contact the plugin's author for help.


**Frequently asked questions & known issues**
=============================================

Please do not submit tickets about these issues. We already know about them, and in some cases, they are not actually bugs.


### **Incoming heals are showing HoT ticks!**

**This is not a bug in Grid.** The game client doesn't differentiate between incoming health from direct heals and incoming health from periodic effects, so Grid cannot specifically filter out HoTs. You can filter out most HoT ticks by using the Minimum Value setting for the Incoming Heals status to hide smaller amounts of healing.


### **Incoming heals are showing the wrong amount!**

**This is not a bug in Grid.** Incoming heal values now come from the game client itself, instead of requiring everyone in your group to install a third-party library to communicate about their healing spells. Grid has no control over the accuracy of incoming heal values; feel free to report such issues in [Blizzard's Bug Report forum](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1012660/).


### **Incoming heals aren't shown at all!**

Check the Minimum Value setting for the Incoming Heals status, and make sure it's set appropriately for your level and gear. It should be set to a number that is lower than the size of a direct heal, but higher than the size of a HoT tick.


### **I'm using version r1234 and it's broken!**

Version numbers that follow the "r1234" pattern are Alpha versions, or snapshots of the current development process, and are not recommended for general use. Such versions **are not officially supported**, may be unstable or not work at all, and may cause you to lose your settings. If you are not comfortable running experimental code, please stick with stable Release and Beta versions, whose numbers follow the "4.0.3.1234" or "4.0.3.1234-beta" patterns.
